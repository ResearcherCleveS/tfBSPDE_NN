Let $\sf U(S, t)$ be the price option as a function of the stock price $\sf S$ and time $\sf t \in [0, T]$. Let $\sf \sigma$ be the volatility stock and $\sf r$ the risk-free interest rate. Then, the governing classical BSPDE is

## $\sf \frac{\partial U}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2S^2\frac{\partial^2U}{\partial S^2}+rS\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}-rU = 0.$
